    "#### This is generally called a dictionary attack. A dictionary attack is when an attacker gets a list of hashed passwords (like the three hashes in the problem), takes a word list of likely passwords (or in other words a dictionary), hashes each candidates passwords the same way I did in the `sha_256_hex()` method with UTF-9 and SHA-256, compares each computed hash to each stored hash and if there is a match the attacker has found the original password. This works extremely well when common passwords are used."
