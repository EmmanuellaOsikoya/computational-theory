# computational-theory

#### This README is a file that will give you context on my repository for the Computational Theory module.

#### This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that aims to answer 5 ([problems](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/computational-theory/blob/main/assessment/problems.md)) related to the ([Secure Hash Standard (SHA-256)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf)).

#### The main purpose of this repository is to:
 -  Explore how cryptographic hash functions work
 -  Practice implementing and testing hash-related algorithms in Pyhton
 -  Understand how hashes are used in real-world applications such as data inegrity and password storage
 -  Demonstrate common security issues that occur when hashes are used incorrectly

 # How to Run the Code
  - Open a terminal and run:
git clone https://github.com/EmmanuellaOsikoya/computational-theory.git

 - Then move into the repository directory:
 cd computational-theory

 - Then install numpy
 pip install numpy
